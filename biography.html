				<p>For more than half a century, Riley B. King – better known as B.B. King – 
				has defined the blues for a worldwide audience. Since he started recording in the 1940s, 
				he has released over fifty albums, many of them classics. He was born September 16, 1925, 
				on a plantation in Itta Bena, Mississippi, near Indianola. In his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, 
				and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his 
				music career. Memphis was where every important musician of the South gravitated, and which supported a large musical 
				community where every style of African American music could be found. B.B. stayed with his cousin Bukka White, one of 
				the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who schooled B.B. further in the art of the blues.	
				<br></br>
				After serving in World War II, Riley B. King, better known as B.B. King, became a disc jockey 
				in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was dubbed "the Beale Street Blues Boy." 
				That nickname was shortened to "B.B." and the guitarist cut his first record in 1949. 
				He spent the next several decades recording and touring, playing more than 300 shows a year. 
				An artist of international renown, King worked with other musicians from rock, pop and country backgrounds. 
				He won his 15th Grammy Award in 2009. B.B. King died in 2015.

				</a>

				<p>Riley B. King was born on September 16, 1925, on a cotton plantation called Berclair, 
				near the town of Itta Bena, Mississippi, the son of sharecroppers Albert and Nora Ella King. 
				He considered the nearby city of Indianola, Mississippi to be his home. When Riley was 4 years old, 
				his mother left his father for another man, so the boy was raised by his maternal grandmother, 
				Elnora Farr, in Kilmichael, Mississippi.
				<br><br>
				While young, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. 
				It seems that at the age of 12 he purchased his first guitar for $15.00, although another 
				source indicates he was given his first guitar by Bukka White, his mother's first cousin 
				(King's grandmother and White's mother were sisters).
				<br><br>
				In November 1941 "King Biscuit Time" first aired, broadcasting on KFFA in Helena, Arkansas. 
				It was a radio show featuring the Mississippi Delta blues. King listened to it while on break at a plantation. 
				A self-taught guitarist, he then wanted to become a radio musician.
				<br><br>
				In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John's Quartet of Inverness, 
				Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood, Mississippi.
				<br><br>
				In 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months. 
				However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterwards, where he decided to prepare himself better for 
				the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny 
				Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's 
				appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a 
				ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. The radio spot became so popular that it was 
				expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club.
				<br><br>
				Initially he worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, gaining the nickname "Beale Street Blues Boy", 
				which was later shortened to "Blues Boy" and finally to B.B. It was there that he first met T-Bone Walker. 
				King said, "Once I'd heard him for the first time, I knew I'd have to have [an electric guitar] myself.
				'Had' to have one, short of stealing!"

					<p>
					King made his first recording in 1949, and the next year began a 12-year-long association with Kent/RPM/Modern, 
					for which he recorded a string of rhythm and blues hits, including "You Know I Love You," "Woke Up This Morning" 
					and "Three O'Clock Blues," which reached No. 1 on the R&B charts and became his first national hit. 
					He also toured the nightclub circuit continuously, averaging more than 300 shows annually for over 30 years. 
					His style of music earned him the title "King of the Blues."
